# Validation

This page records the build, binary, card, and device checks for Nocturne v1.0.2.

## Build provenance

| Release | Nocturne v1.0.2 |
| Binary commit | `c2a09365` |
| H700 workflow | [41175554962](https://github.com/NadimHider/nocturne/actions/runs/41175554962), success |
| Full CI | [41175554920](https://github.com/NadimHider/nocturne/actions/runs/41175554920), success |
| Device | Anbernic RG40XX H |
| Card | exFAT, label `Roms` |
| Validation date | 2026-10-31 |

The release tag includes the documentation update that follows the binary commit. The binaries in the release archive were built from `c2a09365`.

The device checks were performed with the frontend binaries built from `04577524` and the boot payload built from `71656dc7`. Commits `71656dc7` and `c2a09365` do not change frontend source. They add the Departure Mono boot splash, align installer text with the Nocturne name, and add the boot payload to CI. The release binaries were rebuilt from `c2a09365`; `minarch.elf` and `settings.elf` differ from the earlier build only because the cross-build is not byte-reproducible. The boot payload in the release is content-identical to the payload validated on the card.

## Automated checks

### Host policy tests

Command:

```sh
make test-nocturne
```

Result: pass. The policy sources are unchanged from v1.0.1, and the same test suite passed for that release.

- Theme normalization: pass
- Switcher navigation and removal policy: pass
- Preview cache promotion, eviction, and clear: pass

The tests cover luminance and contrast normalization, selection text derivation, recent-list navigation, two-step removal, and the three-entry LRU preview cache. The policy sources are unchanged from v1.0.1.

### Full CI

Run [41175554920](https://github.com/NadimHider/nocturne/actions/runs/41175554920) completed successfully.

- All core build jobs passed.
- The aggregate build job passed.
- The package, upload, and attestation stages passed.

### H700 build

Run [41175554962](https://github.com/NadimHider/nocturne/actions/runs/41175554962) completed successfully.

- The H700 cross-build passed.
- The update archive was packaged and uploaded.
- The boot payload was packaged and uploaded as the `h700-boot` artifact.
- The archives were downloaded and installed for validation.

## Binary verification

The installed binaries are aarch64 ELF files. Their `DT_NEEDED` dependency lists match the previous build.

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| ELF class | 64-bit |
| Machine | AArch64 (183) |
| Dependency changes | None |
| Frontend hash matches artifact | Pass |
| MinArch hash matches artifact | Pass |
| Settings hash matches artifact | Pass |

## Boot payload verification

The boot shim is a shell script followed by a gzip-compressed tar archive. The embedded payload contains `fbsplash`, `unzip`, and `shim-common.sh`.

```text
dmenu.bin        CFD545ADF2761D0022A164ED49AECD57908CF607706B74ECB3DEC0D9CDDBF7D1
```

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Script line endings | LF only |
| Payload archive | Valid gzip and tar |
| `fbsplash` machine | AArch64 (183) |
| `fbsplash` GLIBC requirement | 2.17 |
| Splash strings | `NOCTURNE` and `STARTING NOCTURNE` present |
| Legacy splash strings | No `NEXTUI` splash strings |
| Validated payload match | Content-identical to the payload tested on the device |

The payload renders Departure Mono glyphs sampled on the font's native 11 px grid. It does not link SDL_ttf, so the splash works before the card is mounted.

## Card verification

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `.system`, `.userdata`, `Tools`, `Emus`, `Bios`, `Saves`, `Shaders`, `Roms` at card root | Pass |
| `.system/h700/bin` contains the release binaries | Pass |
| `.system/h700/dat/dmenu.bin` contains the release boot payload | Pass |
| `Tools/h700/Settings.pak` contains the release Settings binary | Pass |
| `Tools/h700/LedControl.pak` contains the release LED Control binary | Pass |
| `Tools/h700/CleanRomset.pak` contains the release cleanup script | Pass |
| `defaultView=0` in `minuisettings.txt` | Pass |
| Built-in palettes present | Pass |
| Removed Next and OG font files absent | Pass |
| Pak Store paks and Quick Menu entry absent | Pass |
| Zero-byte files under `.system` | None |
| `chkdsk` file system scan | No problems |
| Dirty bit | Not set |
| Volume cache | Flushed before eject |

## Device checklist

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Boot splash reads `NOCTURNE` in Departure Mono with the teal rule and `STARTING NOCTURNE` | Pass |
| Boots to the game-system list by default | Pass |
| Pills render with clean rounded corners and centered text | Pass |
| List typography is reduced and remains readable | Pass |
| Selection glide is smooth | Pass |
| Screen transitions are smooth | Pass |
| Font menu lists only Departure Mono, Silkscreen, Home Video, and Fake Receipt | Pass |
| Font choice persists across frontend restarts | Pass |
| Quick Menu has no Pak Store entry | Pass |
| SFC game art appears for Soul Blazer | Pass |
| PS game art appears for MediEvil II | Pass |
| Arcade game art appears for 1942 | Pass |
| Game launches and exits to the frontend | Pass |

The device checks were performed on the RG40XX H. The boot payload is copied from `.system/h700/dat/dmenu.bin` to the boot partition by `h700-init.sh` on the first boot after installation, so the new splash appears on the following boot.

## Reproducing the build

```sh
git clone https://github.com/NadimHider/nocturne.git
cd nocturne
git checkout c2a09365
make setup
make build PLATFORM=h700 COMPILE_CORES=false
```

The H700 workflow uses the same source and toolchain image. The build is not reproducible byte for byte for `minarch.elf` and `settings.elf`, so release artifacts should be taken from the workflow run that matches the release commit.

## Known limitations

- Nocturne is a component bundle. It does not install Base OS, a bootloader, a kernel, emulator cores, BIOS files, or ROMs.
- The release targets the H700 platform and the RG40XX H. Other H700 devices may work but are not part of this validation.
- Emulator performance and compatibility depend on the selected libretro core, ROM set, and BIOS files.
- Wi-Fi and Bluetooth behavior depends on the Base OS drivers and the local network or accessory.
- HDMI behavior depends on the display and cable. Hotplug handling restarts the frontend by design.
- Game art is card data. The frontend reads `<rom-name>.png` from each system's `.media` folder. The release does not include art.

## Release artifact

`Nocturne-v1.0.2-H700-components.zip` contains the frontend, MinArch, key monitor, supporting utilities, the boot payload, ten palettes, Settings, LED Control, CleanRomset, and `.system/version.txt`.
